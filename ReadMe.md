I have chosen use case 2 (Ruter). I chose to use a regressional algorithm because the output for the use case will be an unknown number of passengers. Classification algorithms are used when there are set answers and you need to figure out which of the set answers are more likely to be true (For example true or false). Since you cannot split an unknown number of passengers into set answers you need to use a regressional algorithm. Within regressional algorithms I chose to use a linear algorithm instead of a polynomial algorithm because I think the number of passengers change too much between each datapoint for a polynomial algorithm to make sense.
